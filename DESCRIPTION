Description: Performs modeling and forecasting of park visitor counts
	using social media data and (partial) on-site visitor counts.
	Specifically, the model is built based on an automatic decomposition
	of the trend and seasonal components of the social media-based park visitor counts,
	from which short-term forecasts of the visitor counts and percent changes
	in the visitor counts can be made. A reference for the underlying model that 'VisitorCounts' uses can be found at 
    'Russell Goebel', Austin Schmaltz, 'Beth Ann Brackett', Spencer A. Wood, 'Kimihiro Noguchi' (2023) <doi:10.1002/for.2965> .
