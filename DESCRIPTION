Description: Performs modeling and forecasting of park visitor counts
	using social media data and (partial) on-site visitor counts.
	Specifically, the model is built based on an automatic decomposition
	of the trend and seasonal components of the social media-based park visitor counts,
	from which short-term forecasts of the visitor counts and percent changes
	in the visitor counts can be made. A reference for generating social media-based
	visitor counts can be found at
	Wood, Guerry, Silver, and Lacayo (2013) <doi:10.1038/srep02976>.
